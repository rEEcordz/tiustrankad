        Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man,
         Wolverine, the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Daredevil, and Iron Fist,
          including such teams as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Guardians of the Galaxy,
           and the Fantastic Four, and antagonists such as Venom, Doctor Doom, the Red Skull,
           the Green Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor Octopus, Magneto, Kang the Conqueror, Mystique,
            and Loki. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as
             the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
              characters are based in New York City.

      <p>Marvel Comics is the common name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide
        Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher
        of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney
        Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.</p>
        <p>
        Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s,
        had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began 1961,
        the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created
        by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others.</p>

          Marvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfitsâ€”unlike the
          perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books.
           Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and
           the Thing. This naturalistic approach even extended into topical politics.
